              <li>You mocked Nancy Pelosi for getting emotional when she reflected on the murder of her friend, Mayor George Moscone, but you think it’s manly when John Boehner blubbers when he watches reruns of Flipper.</li>
              <li>You think Climate Change is a big hoax because Senator James Inhofe, firmly in the pocket of the oil companies says it’s bogus.</li>
              <li>You think president Obama’s birth certificate is a forgery, and that he managed to fool the CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service and the entire US government archive of documents with one Photoshopped image.</li>
              <li>You think president Obama is a socialist, because he wants all Americans to pay their share of taxes, including the rich, and all Americans to enjoy the same benefits of an equitable society, including the same healthcare that Congress enjoys.</li>
